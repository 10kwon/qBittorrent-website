This repository contains the official qBittorrent website: https://qbittorrent.org

Anyone is welcome to submit PRs that fix problems and improve things.

You can also submit redesigns but first open a bug report informing us and maybe show some mockups. Otherwise, you run the risk of wasting your time in case we won't agree with the redesign.
